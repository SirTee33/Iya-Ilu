    "history": "The Iya-Ilu is the lead drum in the Yoruba talking drum ensemble, often referred to as the mother drum.It holds a significant place in traditional music, storytelling, and communication. Through variations in pitch and rhythm, it can mimic the tones of human speech, allowing drummers to speak messages.\nDundun is a Yoruba word that refers to a family of variable tension drums. The pitch of these hourglass-shaped drums can be changed by squeezing the ties that join the two drumheads between the left arm and the torso while the drum is being struck with a curved stick. This feature is used to mimic the tones and cadence of human speech. The iya ilu, or mother drum, is considered the lead instrument in the ensemble.\nTraditionally, the Iya-Ilu leads ceremonies, festivals, and royal events, played by skilled drummers who train for years to master its language. It is crafted from wood and animal hide, with tension cords to adjust pitch dynamically.This instrument is considered the most important drum by the Yoruba, who call it iya, literally, 'the mother'.\nIt is played in almost any situation that requires music, mimicking spoken Yoruba speech tones. The varying sounds are obtained by holding the drum under the arm and squeezing the tension strings while striking the membrane with a curved stick. The bells also add sound.",
